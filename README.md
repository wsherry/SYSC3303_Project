-Fixed the server so that it continues to run after waiting for a request.
-Duplicate packed functionalitu 
-UI to the error simualator that allows the user to configure between differnt options 
-When set time has passed (currently 1 second), Client will resend read/write 
request if no response is received.
-During transfer, if the side that sends the data packets does not receive an ACK packet 
within 1 second, the previous data packet is resent 
-During transfer, if the server does not receive a data packet within
a reasonably long period of time (currently 5 minutes) the server ends the transfer and 
closes the connection (Idle timeout not implemented for Client yet)


Project Overview for Iteration 0 and 1:
The programs allows clients to establish WRQ connections and RRQ connections with the server. This is done due to the implementation of steady-state file transfer between the client and the server. Ever RRQ the server will respond with specific data block of 0-1 bytes in order to see if a file was written or read from properly respond witha ACK block 0. For every WRQ request ther sever will The error simulator will just pass on packets (client to server, and server to client).The server has a new thread that represents a new client and this connection thread is used to connect with the client. The error simulator in this iteration only passes a package between the client and the server, in this iteration no error simulation is done. 

Project Overview for Iteration 2:
The server and client are able to now handle network errors ( lost, delayed, duplicaiton). While having the side sending the data files also be able to have a timeout and retransmit.The UI will also allow the user to pick particular modes they would like to configure the program to run in. 

Project Overview for Iteration 3: 
Implementing errors that can occur in aTFTP packets that is received.   TFTP
ERROR packets  should be able to prepared, transmitted,received, and handled (Error Code 4, 5) must be prepared, transmitted,
received, and handled. There will be an assumption that no input file errors, in this iteration. 

Project Overview for Iteration 4:
Add support for ERROR packets both the client and server code
from Iteration #3. Must catch exceptions thrown by your Java read/write
code and translate the exceptions to the appropriate TFTP error codes. Direct testing should be functional for all the errors withouth having to update the error simulator.

Project Overview for Iteration 5:
Handle a scenario where the client and the server can reside on different computers.

Errors Iteration 2:
TFTPClientConnection currently doesnâ€™t use port 69 for receiving data

Errors Iteration 5: 
Extra boundary cases eith error code 4 that werent considered ( missed in the presentation demo)

Overview of each class:

Request.java: A basic enum class that is used to identify the services a client needs the server to provide. the three enum that are currently being used as identifications of the tasks are read, write and error.

Server.java :
The server receives a read or write packet from a client and sends back the appropriate response without any actual file transfer

Client.java :
Implements the shut down method that forces the server to finsh tranfering all current files that are currnetly in progress with continuing to create new connections with other clients. All has a simple user interface that can be seen in the command line.

FTPClientConnectionThread.java
Creates connections between different clients and servers to process requests such as read and write and errors

TFTPSim.java
The simulator receives a read or write packet from a client and passes it on to the server.  Upon receiving a response, it passes it on to the client.
