Your error simulation code must be a completely separate program (or programs)
from your client and server code. The error simulator communicates with the client
and the server using DatagramSocket objects. The number of threads for this code is
your choice. We will use port 23 for the error simulator. Your error simulator may be
single-threaded and is expected to work with one client only. To test multiple clients
when using just one machine, send requests directly to port 69. (Once we move to
multiple machines, it is recommended that the error simulator runs on the same
computer as the client.) However, if you wish to make the error simulator multithreaded, that is your choice.
